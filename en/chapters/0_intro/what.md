# What is Urban Visualization

Urban visualization is a type of data driven intervention, where data is transformed into visual aids common in the data visualization world but built on top or using common elements in physical spaces.

We will explore there types of urban visualizations that can be created by anyone.

There can be multiple motivations to create urban visualizations. People can use them to communicate directly with an audience at specific location. Their use might provoque a cultural change on the topics treated in the visualization.

The types of communications are strictly confined in the data domain. Luckily for us, most topics can be viewed from a data driven perspetive.

Take politics, sports, feminism, religion and you will very likely find some data to support your claims.

Data is subjective, and data driven analysis can be biased, on purpose or not, towards a particular view of the world. It is only with diffusion and democratization that we can find common grounds by comparing multiples views of the world that we can move forward as society.
