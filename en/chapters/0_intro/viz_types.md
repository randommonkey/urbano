# Visualization types - Pseudoviz

For citizens to be able to select the types of visualizations that suit them best they must be aware of what they have at hand.

Through out the book we will refer to pseudo viz to the different types of visualizations that can be made.

A Pseudoviz is a high level description of a visualization. It uses sketches to depict the a visual representation of data. Specific details of the visualization might be deliberately omitted with the purpose to leave the pseudoviz in the abstract. Details that are usually omitted correspond to legends, titles, axis ticks or annotations, as they can be thought of as optional parameters for a given visualization. Details or features that might a particular software to create the visualizations are also intentionaly omitted.

Through the book we will use the pseudoviz created by __jpmarindiaz__ and available under a creative commons international license. For an exhaustive browsable list of Pseudoviz check out Datasketch's project [Pseudoviz](http://datasketch.co/en/pseudoviz)

The Pseudoviz used in the urban data visualizations proposed in this book are detailed in the next sections.
