# Tailored visualizations

This type of Urban Visualizations correspond to tailored made interventions on static physical spaces.

The idea is to use what is already there for particular objects and turn them into visualizations.

Here are some examples:

- Turn an arc into a dial chart.
- Turn a stop signal into a pie chart.
- Turn a specific park sign into a .
- Turn a bathroom sign into a gender visualization.
- Turn windows in a building into a waffle chart.
- Turn a bridge into giant lollipop charts.
