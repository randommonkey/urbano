## Creating a data visualization

With the place and pseudo viz picked, all you have to do is find the visualization that represents the physical place.

It might be tricky to find the right data. We advice you to look for open data portals that have a lot of different information.

- The most common visualization types that can be found in public space relate to proportions. Look for data that can be expressed as counts of categories or proportions.


## Lebeling the embedded visualization

One option would be to use chalk or a blank paper sticker to write the labels and values of the visualization.


Eye comparisons of sizes and proportions in a public space are highly influenced by view angles and depth. Creating a label from the right perspective will definitely help convey the message with the visualizations. That's why we recommend creating a custom legend for your visualization. 

You can take a picture of the place, overlay the visualization with any photoediting software and print it to place it as legend.
